# Processing a Series of Items with Iterators in Rust
Iterators are objects that produce sequences of values, so they can be iterated or looped over. Or, in other words, every time you ended up using a for loop in your program, you were most likely interacting with some kind of iterator.

An Iterators is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you donâ€™t have to re-implement that logic yourself.

In Rust, iterators are lazy, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator to use it up.
